### CV Reader

In the Main you have some examples of how an object can be serialized and
how to be deserialized back into an object and also some helper methods in order 
to do some file processing.

The CV is just a simple blueprint of a real one and you'll need to enrich the current 
model with some more details. (work experience, hobbies, Achievements, github link)

When the application starts a menu will be shown and the user will be asked to select
one of the following options:

* Insert a CV in the database
* Read my CV from the database
* Get list of CV

#### Bonus
* You can create some filters and only those cvs are returned; 
e.g: only those who graduated in the last year will be shown; the user has a github link
